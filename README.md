# digipet

A small web game where you care for a digital pet.

## A note from the developer - Matt Pruett
This project represents a small part of my free-time. I am not an artist, so all assets were taken from opengameart.com, but the code was written entirely by me. I chose to center the digital pet game around an HTML5 canvas to more familiarize myself with how to draw using said canvas as well as showcase my Javascript skills and my ability to follow OOP paradigms and design styles.

This project is far from complete. I hope to one day finish it up but the primary purpose was to showcase my programming skills.

## ToDo:
* Add amination/state for pooping (I cannot believe that's something I had to write.)
* Add ability to clean said poo.
* Add ability to name pet
* Add reset button
* State transitions could use some serious smoothing out. It's very sudden and the sprite does not end up exactly where it was from the previous state.
* Add happy emote
* I would like the feed call to be done when the food toolbar tool hovers over the pet after a few seconds, not just immediately.
* Consolidate and minimize the javascript files. I normally like having the code well-organized into logical files, but that's not typical of javascript.
* Move some of the logic server-side so an enterprising user can't easily manipulate the pet using javascript.
* Add GUIDs to the hard-coded HTML IDs in order to allow multiple on a single page. 
* Various other items in the code commented with "TODO".

## Technologies and Libraries
* HTML5
* Javascript
* CSS
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
